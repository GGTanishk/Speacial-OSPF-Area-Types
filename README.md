# Speacial-OSPF-Area-Types
The motive of the lab was to put our research on the special areas of OSPF, i.e. Stub, totally Stubby, and Not-So-Stubby Areas, to real life. The areas differ from one another as they all pass out different types of Link State Advertisements, and in some cases the area needs to have a special network. We had to implement all the special areas of OSPF in one topology and make the whole work, hence, giving us a significant knowledge of OSPF, and gaining an experience of implementing different kinds of OSPF areas, and verifying their existence on a Protocol Analyzer. The Protocol Analyzer that we used for this lab was Wireshark.
